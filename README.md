# Vocabulary Quiz Program

This C program is a simple vocabulary quiz game that reads questions and answers from a text file and quizzes the user. The program fetches a random line from the `Quiz.txt` file, displays a question, and prompts the user to input an answer. The program then evaluates the answer and provides feedback.

## Features
